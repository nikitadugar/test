We eat, sleep, pray and most importantly love DevOps. We are working towards stratergies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.

## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 0.12](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)

## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-acm/releases).

Here are some examples of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
### ACM with DNS
```hcl
module "acm" {
  source            = "git::https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-acm.git"
  name              = "certificate"
  application       = "clouddrove"
  environment       = "test"
  label_order       = ["environment", "name", "application"]
  domain_name       = "clouddrove.com"
  validation_method = "DNS"
  dns_validation    = false
}
```

### ACM with Email
```hcl
module "acm" {
  source                = "git::https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-acm.git"
  name                  = "certificate"
  application           = "clouddrove"
  environment           = "test"
  label_order           = ["environment", "name", "application"]
  domain_name           = "clouddrove.com"
  validation_method     = "EMAIL"
  validate_certificate  = false
}
```

### ACM with Import Certificate
```hcl
module "acm" {
  source              = "git::https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-acm.git"
  name                = "certificate"
  application         = "clouddrove"
  environment         = "dev"
  label_order         = ["environment", "name", "application"]
  private_key         = "./../../../clouddrove-private-key.pem"
  certificate_body    = "./../../../clouddrove-cert.pem"
  certificate_chain   = "./../../../clouddrove-chain.crt"
  import_certificate  = true
}
```

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| application | Application (e.g. `cp` or `clouddrove`). | string | - | yes |
| certificate_body | Path of certificate body. | string | `~` | no |
| certificate_chain | Path of certificate chain. | string | `` | no |
| create_acm_certificate | Set to false to prevent the creation of a acm certificate. | string | `true` | no |
| dns_validation | Set to prevent validation of DNS. | string | `false` | no |
| domain_name | A domain name for which the certificate should be issued. | string | `` | no |
| environment | Environment (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`). | string | - | yes |
| import_certificate | Set to true or false to decide the creation and import of a acm certificate. | string | `false` | no |
| label_order | Label order, e.g. `name`,`application`. | list | `<list>` | no |
| name | Name  (e.g. `app` or `cluster`) | string | - | yes |
| private_key | Path of private key. | string | `` | no |
| ttl | Time to live. | string | `600` | no |
| validate_certificate | Set to false to prevent the validation of a acm certificate. | string | `false` | no |
| validation_method | Which method to use for validation, DNS or EMAIL. | string | `` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| arn | The ARN of the Certificate. |
| domain_validation_options | The domain validation option of the Certificate. |
| id | The ID of the Certificate. |
| tags | A mapping of tags to assign to the resource. |

## Testing

In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
