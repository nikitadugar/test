This module is a best-practices definition for run a piece of infrastructure such as database, clusters and storage. This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and include automate tests and examples. This module helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead to maintain the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.

## Prerequisites

These are few dependencies of modules:

- [Terraform 0.12](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go Environment](https://golang.org/doc/install)

There are some go packages which also need:

- github.com/stretchr/testify/assert
- github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform

## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-acm/releases).

Here are some examples of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
### ACM with DNS
```hcl
module "acm" {
  source            = "git::https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-acm.git"
  name              = "certificate"
  application       = "clouddrove"
  environment       = "test"
  label_order       = ["environment", "name", "application"]
  domain_name       = "clouddrove.com"
  validation_method = "DNS"
  dns_validation    = false
}
```

### ACM with Email
```hcl
module "acm" {
  source                = "git::https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-acm.git"
  name                  = "certificate"
  application           = "clouddrove"
  environment           = "test"
  label_order           = ["environment", "name", "application"]
  domain_name           = "clouddrove.com"
  validation_method     = "EMAIL"
  validate_certificate  = false
}
```

### ACM with Import Certificate
```hcl
module "acm" {
  source              = "git::https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-acm.git"
  name                = "certificate"
  application         = "clouddrove"
  environment         = "dev"
  label_order         = ["environment", "name", "application"]
  private_key         = "./../../../clouddrove-private-key.pem"
  certificate_body    = "./../../../clouddrove-cert.pem"
  certificate_chain   = "./../../../clouddrove-chain.crt"
  import_certificate  = true
}
```

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| application | application (e.g. `cp` or `clouddrove`) | string | - | yes |
| certificate_body | path of certificate body | string | `~` | no |
| certificate_chain | path of certificate chain | string | `` | no |
| create_acm_certificate | Set to false to prevent the creation of a acm certificate. | string | `true` | no |
| dns_validation | Set to prevent validation of DNS. | string | `false` | no |
| domain_name | A domain name for which the certificate should be issued | string | `` | no |
| environment | Environment (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`) | string | - | yes |
| import_certificate | Set to true or false to decide the creation and import of a acm certificate. | string | `false` | no |
| label_order | label order, e.g. `name`,`application` | list | `<list>` | no |
| name | Name  (e.g. `app` or `cluster`) | string | - | yes |
| private_key | path of private key | string | `` | no |
| ttl | Time to live. | string | `600` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| arn | The ID of the s3 bucket |
| domain_validation_options | The ID of the s3 bucket |
| id | The ID of the s3 bucket |
| tags | A mapping of tags to assign to the resource. |

## Testing

In this module testing are performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and in this testing at your AWS account create this small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure. This testing is written in go, so need a [go environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
